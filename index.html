        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; width: auto;">Mouse over this paragraph, What I find
            remarkable is that this
            text has been the indusrty's standard dummary text ever
            since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrampled
            it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four
            countries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic
            typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional
            'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when then-understood
            Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek;
            the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!"
            (The editors published his letter in a correction headlined "Lorem Oopsum").
